      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a software engineer living in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>
        I love building things, most of the time with Javascript & Node, Ruby on Rails or wood.
        I have a passion for creating user-facing applications that are both functional and visually appealing. I've worked extensively with ecommerce platforms and analytics, personally implementing a custom analytics solution for a large ecommerce site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also built a few cutting boards and a coffee table, with some more ideas that are probably too ambitious.
      </p>
    </div>
