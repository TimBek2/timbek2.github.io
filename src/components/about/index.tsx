      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a software engineer living in Brooklyn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love building things, most of the time with Javascript & Node, Ruby on Rails or wood.
        I have a passion for creating user-facing applications that are both functional and visually appealing. I've worked extensively with ecommerce platforms and analytics, and am always looking for new challenges to further develop my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always looking to work somewhere that values high quality code equally with collaboration and continuing education and development of its employees. I love working on challenging problems that require creative solutions, and I think that we do our best work when we collaborate with others and share our knowledge. Siloing information is a problem that only compounds over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also built a few cutting boards and a coffee table, with some more ideas that are probably too ambitious.
      </p>
    </div>
